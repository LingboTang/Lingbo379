Features of processes - scheduling, creation and termination

Exploring interprocess communication (IPC)

Process - Execution progresses in sequential fashion

One program - Several processes - shared by several users

Process Control Block (PCB)

Information associated with each process (also called task control block)
	Process state - running, waiting, etc
	Program counter - location of next instruction to be executed
	CPU registers
	CPU Scheduling information priority, position in process queue
	Information about allocated memory
	Accounting information -process number (pid), CPU time used
	I/O status information - allocated I/O devices, list of open files

Threads
	MT -> perform multiple tasks concurrently
		Beneficial on multi-core systems
		Multiple program counters
		PCB contains additional info for each thread

Process Scheduling
	Multiprogramming - CPU switches among processes
	Process scheduler selects next process for CPU
	Different queues of processes are maintained
		Job queue - set of all processes in the system
		Ready queue - set of all processes residing in main memory, ready and waiting to execute
		Device queue - set of processes waiting for a device
	Processes migrate among the various queues

Context Switching
	When running process waits --> CPU switches to another process
	Save the state of the old process and load the saved state of the new process: context switching
	Context of a process represented in the PCB
	Context-switch time is over head
		The more complex the OS and the PCB -> longer the switching time
		Some hardware provides multiple sets of registers -> multiple contexts loaded at once

Parent process creates child processes
	Process is identified by a process identifier (pid)
	Resource sharing options
	Parent and children share all resources
	Children share subset of parent’s resources
	Parent and child share no resources
	Execution options
	Parent and children execute concurrently
	Parent waits until children terminate

Unix System Initialization
	swapper
		A kernel process
		No program on disk corresponds to this process
	Init
		Invoked by the kernel after bootstrapping
		Does system-dependent initialization
		Can be found at /sbin (depends on version)
		User process running with superuser privileges

Process Termination
	May terminate normally or unexpectedly
		Status data returned from child to parent (via wait())
		Allocated resources are released by OS
		Normal termination using the exit() system call
		Unexepected termination due to error
	Parent terminates a child using the abort() system call
		Child has exceeded allocated resources
		Task assigned to child is no longer required
		The parent is exiting and OS does not allow a child to continue if its parent terminates -> may result cascading termination
		Cascading termination may be initiated by OS

Process Termination
	Parent process may wait for termination of a child by using the wait()system call. The call returns status information and the
	pid of the terminated processpid = wait(&status);
	Zombie process – a child process that terminated but its parent has not call wait() yet
	Orphan process – a child process whose parent terminated: init process (pid = 1) becomes parent.


Interprocess Communication
	Processes may be independent or cooperating
	Cooperation initiated by interprocess communication (IPC)
	Reasons for Coop:
		Information sharing - several users may require same piece of information
		Computation speedup - a task can broken into subtasks which execute in parallel
		Modularity - construct system in modular fashion, to promote writing, understanding and testing the system`1 
		Convenience - processes can decide what to communicate with minimal risk
	
	Two models of IPC
		Shared memory – faster, convenient for large amount of data,system call only during creation & termination
		Message passing – slower due to repetitive system call, convenient for small amount of data
	Signals (in UNIX) offer bare form of communication


Direct Communication

	Processes must name each other explicitly (symmetric addressing)
		* send (P, message) send a meesage to process P
		* receive(Q, message) - receive a message from process Q
	In a client-server system, server does not know the nmae of a specific client in order to receive a message; use asymmetric addressing
		* send(P, message) - Sender still needs to know recipient process
		* listen(ID, message) - Receive a pending (posted) message
	Properties of direct communication link
		* Links are established automatically
		* Exactly one link is associated with exactly one pair of processes
		* The link may unidirectional or bi-directional

Indirect Communication
	
	Messages sent to and retrieved from mailboxes
		Each mailbox has a unique id
		Processes can communicate if they share a mailbox
		send(A, message) — Send message to mailbox A
		receive(A, message) — Receive message from mailbox A
	Decouples sender and receiver, which is more flexible
	Usually mailbox associated with many senders/receivers; if only one receiver attached with a particular mailbox, then that mailbox is often called a port
	Properties of indirect communication link
		A link established if processes share a common mailbox
		A link may be associated with many processes
		Each pair of processes may share several communication links
		Link may be unidirectional or bi-directional

Synchronization
	
	Message passing may be either blocking or non-blocking
	Blocking is considered sysnchronous
		* Blocking send -- ther sender is blocked until the message is received
		* Blocking receive -- the receiver is blocked until a message is available
	Non-blocking is considered asynchronous
		* Non-blocking send -- the sender sends the message and continue
		* Non-blocking receive -- the receiver receives:
			* A valid message, or
			* Null messgae
	If both send and receive are blocking, it is called a rendezvous

Buffering
	
	Message queues are attached to the link (D or inD coommunication)
	Queues implemented in one of three ways
		1. Zero capacity - no messages are queued on a link. Sender must wait for receiver (rendezvous)
		2. Bounded capacity -finite length of n messages. Sneder must4 wait if link full
		3. Unbounded capacity - inifinite length. Sender never waits
