How to run this?
	1. In terminal type: make.
	   If you want to clean the junk file: make clean
	2. The first input will be how many resource types are there in the simulation system
	   Type a number and hit enter like:2, characters will be invalid input and broke the program.
	3. The second input will be the detail of the Maximum resource quantity of each resource
	   in the system.
	   Type a series of number splited by space like: 2 2 3
	4. The third input will be how many process are there in the simulation system.
	   Type a number and hit enter like:2, characters will be invalid input and broke the program.
	5. The fourth input will be the detail of the Maximum possible request of each process.But make
	   sure this should be 
	   Type a series of number splited by space like:P1:2 1 1
													 P2:0 1 1
													 P3:0 0 1

1. I'll check the initial state using safety algorithm.
   If the safety is not satisfied,I'll quit the program
   by print the error message: Allocation Overflow.

2. I'll check the safety inside, but instead of leting it quit
   I'll just let one of processes release all their allocations.
   With a inform message "Self Rescue!".

3. Function Safety_checker referrenced from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm
