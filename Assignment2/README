How to make it precisely?
1. gcc -o server server.c
2. gcc -o client client.c

and then ./server
and then ./client


5 brief step for myself to do the part a:
1. Write a function to randomly generate IP in char* (in C, we can use char* to represent the string)
2. Figure out how to pass the arguement
3. Figure out how to do the file I/O
4. Write the package sending and recieving through socket. Build up a struct which contains 
	int packet id;
	char* sourceIP;
	char* destinationIP;
	int TTL;
	char* payload;
5. write this into the statistic file.
