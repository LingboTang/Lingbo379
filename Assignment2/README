How to make it precisely?
1. gcc -o server server.c
2. gcc -o client client.c

and then ./server
and then ./client


2 brief step remaining for myself to do the part a:
4. Write the package sending and recieving through socket. Build up a struct which contains 
	int packet id;
	char* sourceIP;
	char* destinationIP;
	int TTL;
	char* payload;
5. write this into the statistic file.
