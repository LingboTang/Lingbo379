This is the Assignment2 partB.


How to run this?

	1. Open the terminal and type make or make all.
	2. After you compine all the files run router first and then pktgen
	3. The command line of router is:
		./file_server <ServerPORT> <server_directory> <log_directory>
		Here, server_directory should be a different directory. So does the log_directory.
		The server is daemonized.
	4. The command line of client is:
		./file_client <ServerIP> <ServerPort> <request_file>
		Here, you should give the same port number as server, because you want your
		pktgen listen to the router. You get the ServerIP manually by typing "ifconfig"
		and then type your ServerIP into the command line. Then the request_file is the
		file name you want to get in the server.
	5. If you want to stop just type ctrl+C, it will save the instant value for you.

	6. After exit. make clean to clean the junk file and open the log files to check results.

	7. make ps is to check the daemonized, and kill it by process ID.
		kill <pid>

	Sample tests:
		./file_server 9090 /cshome/lingbo/Server /cshome/lingbo/Serverlog
		./file_client 127.0.0.1 9090 test2.txt
