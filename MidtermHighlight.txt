Types of scheduler:
Short-term scheduler (or CPU scheduler) - selects a process residing in main memory for allocating the CPU. May be preemptive or non-preemptive
	> NPS,current process runs until it block (waiting for an event or a resouce) or it terminates
	> PS, currently active process may be suspended and CPU is allocated to another process
Long-term scheduler (or job scheduler) - selects and moves a process from disk to ready queue in main memory.
	> Controls the degree of multiprogramming
	> Strives for good process mix of I/O-bound and CPU-bound processes
Medium-term scheduler suspends or resumes processes by swapping (rolling) them out of or into memory.

What's the shortage of using SJF(Shortest Job first) algorithm in CPU scheduling? > We have to know the length of each process, and sometimes we might not know if a short process must follow a long process

How to show the shceduling chart? 
	> Represent each of the process in bar chart number the time interval
	> note that for the first appeared process, the waiting time is zero.


Length of Next CPU Burst
	> Can only estimate the length - should  be similar to the previoius one.
		> Previous burst length is used in decision making

	> Exponential average of all previous CPU bursts.
		> Look at the Latex file (Similar to the N-armed bandit)
	> Commonly , \alpha set to 1/2

Shortest-remaining-time-first

	> Preemptive version of SJF
	> Now we add the concepts of varying arrival times and preemption to the analysis
		Process		Arrival Time 	Burst Time
		P1		0		8
		P2		1		4
		P3		2		9
		P4		3		5


Priority Scheduling

	> A priority number is associated with each process
		> Internal (process attributes)
		> External (characteristics not related to OS)
	> The CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority
		( smallest integer => highest priority, not true for all systems)
		> Preemptive
		> Non-preemptive
	> FCFS & SJF are priority scheduling. In FCFS, the process that comes earlier has higher priority. In SJF, priority is the inverse of predicted next CPU burst time
	
	> PRONLEM!!!!: Starvation - low priority processes may never execute
		> SOLUTION!!!!: Aging -as time passes increase the priority of the process
	Note ch06.pdf page 20!!!!!

Round Robin (RR)

	> Designed specially for time-sharing systems
	> Each process gets a small unit of CPU time (time slice or time quantum q), usually 10-100 ms
	> If n processes in the ready queue, each process gets at most q time units at once. No process waits more than (n-1) q time units.

	> Timer interrupts every quantum to schedule next process
	> Performance depends on time quantum (q)
		> q large => RR becomes FCFS
		> q small => context switching (< 10 us) overhead would be high
		> Rule of thumb: 80% CPU bursts should be smaller than q


Some rules of thumb:
	> FCFS performs better for long processes and favours CPU-bound jobs
	> FCFS not suitable for interactive jobs
	> RR not suitalbe for batch jobs 
	> SJF long processes may suffer CPU starvation
	> Overhead negligible in FCFS, moderate in RR and higher in SJF

Scheduling Different Process Types

	> There is no single solution
		> Multi-level scheduling - separate queues for different process types
		> Multi-level feedback queue scheduling - more flexible variant of multilevel queue scheduling

Multilevel Queue Scheduling
	> Natural separation between foreground and background jobs, since have separate queues
	> Can take advantage of simple scheduling algorithms, since know what types of processes will be in each queue
	> Disadvantages
		> Some overhead to maintain different queues ( which might be offset by the fact that each queue is now shorter)
		> Fixed queue each process - what to do if a process has varied properties

Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling
	
	> A process can move among various queues based on current properties
		> Aging can be implemented this way
	> Multilevel-feedback-queue scheduler has some parameters:
		> Number of queues
		> Scheduling algorithm for each queue
		> Method to initially assign a process to a queue
		> Method used to determine when to upgrade a process
		> Method used to determine when to demote a process
