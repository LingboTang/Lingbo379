This is the Assignment about handle the signal and scan the virtual memory.

Four core file is needed:
	1.memchunk.c (Countains the main function)
	2.memchunk.h (Countains all function prototype and global variables)
	3.testmem.c (Added one testcase)
	4.Makefile (compile script)


In this assignment I didn't write the command line to handle input variables
Therefore, to change the testsize and other info, just go to the testmem and chang it.
If you want to run the program: simply type 'make' in the terminal and then type ./testmem
If you want to delete the bin files: simply type 'make clean' and it will excute.
