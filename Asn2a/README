This is the Assignment2 partA.


How to run this?

	1. Open the terminal and type make or make all.
	2. After you compine all the files run router first and then pktgen
	3. The command line of router is:
		./router <RouterPORT> <Routing_table> <statistic_log>
		Here, routing_table should be in the same directory with router and pktgen.
		And the file name is "RT_A.txt"
	4. The command line of client is:
		./pktgen <RouterPORT> <pktgen_log>
		Here, you should give the same port number as router, because you want your
		pktgen listen to the router.
	5. If you want to stop just type ctrl+C, it will save the instant value for you.

	6. After exit. make clean to clean the junk file and open the log files to check results.


Problem:
	I will lose 5 package when I was recieving the first 5 packges.
	But for the other 20 packages after the first 5 package. It will not
	lose. You can check it by deleting the fseek line and copy the intializing
	counter line in the router.c

Thanks!
